# USB-Linux
A version of Arch Linux that is meant to be flashed on to USB drives as a recovery tool or just another OS to mess around with

This is in beta testing as of June 27th 2025.

The packages that are included with this version are the normal Arch packages and git, less, and base-devel.

Include all open source drivers. but it was installed with a legacy NVIDIA gpu so that is reccomended.

Root password is: root

I reccomend to use the default account that i have created called: user

The password to the "user" account is: 0000
